# eco-emails
R script for reproducible parsing of email data from religious environmental groups. 

For the most part, I'm using the conventions outlined by Kieran Healy [here](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html). The idea is that this will serve as "[reproducible research](http://kbroman.org/steps2rr/)" by which anyone can download the contents of this repository, execute the R code which will gather data used from open and sustainable repositories, and then conduct the analysis I've done. 

The file `newsletter-parse.R` contains working code which will be eventually moved into a merged .RMd file.

Paths are used mostly for R processing (I use [R Studio](http://rstudio.com)). Towards this end folders have the following significance:

- `data` contains datasets used for analysis.
- `derived_data` contains files which represent modified forms of files in the above path.
- `figures` contains images and visualisations (graphic files) which are generated by R for the final form of the document.
- `cache` isn't included in github but is usually used for working files
